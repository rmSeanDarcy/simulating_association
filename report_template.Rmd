### Figure 1: Positive Co-occurrences

Figure 1 shows the number of positive co-occurrences that were determined for all treatments. We also show the numbers of matches these co-occurrences had with either interactions (orange) and/or environmental preference similarity (green).

```{r fig2_B, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Positive co-occurrences", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0("Result_master_dir/", params$experiment, "/Fig2_B.png"))
```

Figure 2 shows the same results just for negative co-occurrences.

```{r fig2_C, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Negative co-occurrences", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0("Result_master_dir/", params$experiment, "/Fig2_C.png"))
```
