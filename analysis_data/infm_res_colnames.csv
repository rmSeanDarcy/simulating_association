full_res_colnames.csv,Meaning
totp,Number of positive co-occurrences
eucp,Precision for detecting positive co-occurrences with similar environmental preference
intp,Precision for detecting positive co-occurrences with interactions
shrp,Precision for detecting positive co-occurrences with two species sharing the same associations with resources (not included in paper)
eucshrp,Precision for intersection
eucintp,Precision for intersection
shrintp,Precision for intersection
eucshrintp,Precision for intersection
unxp,"Precision for detecting positive co-occurrences with no discernible driver (meaning those that donâ€™t match eucp, intp or shrp)"
eucp_cor,Precision for detecting positive co-occurrences with ONLY similar environmental preference (excludes intersections with intp and shrp)
shrp_cor,Analogous to above (excludes eucp and intp)
intp_cor,Analogous to above (excludes eucp and shrp)
eucshrp_cor,Analogous to above for the intersection of eucp and shrp (here excludes any intersection with intp)
eucintp_cor,Analogous to above (excludes any intersection with shrp)
shrintp_cor,Analogous to above (excludes any intersection with eucp)
eucp_corA,Precision for detecting positive co-occurrences with ONLY similar environmental preference (here excludes intersections with ONLY intp; shrp is ignored here). This is the green bar area in the data shown in Fig.2 B!
intp_corA,Analogous to above (excludes any intersection with eucp). This is the orange bar area in Fig.2 B!
eucintp_corA,Intersection of eucp and intp. This is the hatched area in Fig.2 B!
unxpA,Precision for detecting positive co-occurrences with no discernible driver (ignores the intersection with shrp)
eucp_corB,"Here in stead of removing shrp we remove intp, comparing how eucp and shrp overlap. Not seen in paper!"
shrp_corB,Analogous to above
eucshrp_corB,Analogous to above
unxpB,Analogous to above
totn,Number of negative co-occurrences. From here all labels are analogous to those above just for negative associations
