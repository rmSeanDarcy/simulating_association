AmbiguousRuleException:
Rules process_clone and process_sim are ambiguous for the file simulation_data/xfig2/s1/s1/sign_ajd_res_log.csv.
Consider starting rule output with a unique prefix, constrain your wildcards, or use the ruleorder directive.
Wildcards:
	process_clone: exp=xfig2,sim=s1,tr=s1
	process_sim: exp=xfig2,sim=s1,tr=s1
Expected input files:
	process_clone: simulation_data/xfig2/s1/s1/.cloned
	process_sim: simulation_data/xfig2/s1/s1/.simulated
Expected output files:
	process_clone: simulation_data/xfig2/s1/s1/sign_ajd_res_log.csv
	process_sim: simulation_data/xfig2/s1/s1/sign_ajd_res_log.csv
