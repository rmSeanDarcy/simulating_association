AmbiguousRuleException:
Rules simulate and clone are ambiguous for the file simulation_data/xfig2/s1/s1/n_pop_log_log.csv.
Consider starting rule output with a unique prefix, constrain your wildcards, or use the ruleorder directive.
Wildcards:
	simulate: exp=xfig2,sim=s1,tr=s1
	clone: exp=xfig2,sim=s1,tr=s1
Expected input files:
	simulate: simulation_scripts/main_simulation.py
	clone: 
Expected output files:
	simulate: simulation_data/xfig2/s1/s1/n_pop_log_log.csv
	clone: simulation_data/xfig2/s1/s1/n_pop_log_log.csv simulation_data/xfig2/s1/s1/.cloned
